            <p>The newly implemented AI generator known as DreamUp has access to all art uploaded to DeviantArt's servers.
                It will scrape all the artist uploaded images to create new art and artists are unhappy that it has access.
                Artists are able to opt out if they please, but they must individually select each piece of art that they wish to exempt.

            <h2>Stable Diffusion update removes ability to copy artist styles or make NSFW works</h2>

            <a href="https://www.engadget.com/stable-diffusion-version-2-update-artist-styles-nsfw-work-124513511.html">Full AI Article</a>
            <time>Nov 25, 2022</time>
            <p>Stable Diffusion was recently updated with all sorts of new bells and whistles, however, an update was pushed to disallow 
                users to attempt to steal another artist's style. Copying another artist's style is technically legal, albeit a legal grey area
                and the devs behind Stable Diffusion seem to be trying to stray away from allowing users to potentially steal another artist's style.
