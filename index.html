            <a href="https://news.artnet.com/art-world/deviantart-dreamup-ai-generator-creators-rights-ip-controversy-2210607">Full AI Article</a>
            <time>Nov 15, 2022</time>
            <p>The newly implemented AI generator known as DreamUp has access to all art uploaded to DeviantArt's servers.
                It will scrape all the artist uploaded images to create new art and artists are unhappy that it has access.
                Artists are able to opt out if they please, but they must individually select each piece of art that they wish to exempt.
